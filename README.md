# node-project-template
### set up your node project quickly

This is a node starter template, includes eslint, prettier, gulp and mocha. If you're just starting out I hope this makes the process easier for you.

Notes:
- The [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) is set up the way I like it. Please modify according to your own needs. 
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) automatically fixes syntax errors that are out of sync with the eslint file
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) is a task runner â€“ it helps you automate things. Currently it's just set up to convert es6/2018 format javascript to node compatible javascript and output it to the dist folder
- [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) is at testing framework. It is set up to run tests located in the test folder. Run mocha by typing `$> npm test` into the terminal. Note there is an eslint file in the test folder, which is necessary for the linter to ignore mocha commands that normally appear undefined to the linter.
